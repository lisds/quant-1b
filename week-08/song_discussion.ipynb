    "genre is either hip-hop or country.  There is one attribute for every word\n",
    "that's in any song.  A song's value for an attribute is the *proportion* of\n",

    "Whenever you build a classifier, it's important to have a separate dataset to test it on.  This is called a *test set*.  The hollow shapes represent songs in the test set, and the filled-in shapes represent songs in the training set.  The test set songs have been labeled with numbers.\n",
