    "In Figure 1(a) the circled item is the only triangle, but in the bottom image the circled item is one of two triangles. While in Figure 1(a) \"the triangle\" is a sufficient description for the circled item, many of us might choose to refer to it as the \"blue triangle\" anyway. In Figure 1(a) there are two triangles, so \"the triangle\" is no longer sufficient, and to describe the circled item we must qualify it with the color as well, as \"the blue triangle\".\n",

They found that in both languages, the subjects used more redundant color adjectives in denser displays where it would be more efficient ([Rubio-Fernandez, Mollica, and Jara-Ettinger 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000963)).

Each subject was asked 10 questions for each type of image (with a different layout of items on the image for each question). The variable of interest to us is `redundant_perc`, which gives the percentage of questions the subject used a redundant adjective to identify \"the blue triangle\". Note that the variable is \"percentage\", and we are interested in the average percentage. Therefore, we will use methods for means. If the variable had been \"success or failure\" (e.g., \"used redundant or didn’t\"), we would have used methods for proportions."
