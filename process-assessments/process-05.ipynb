    "The movie [Moneyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)) focuses on the \"quest for the secret of success in baseball\". It follows a low-budget team, the Oakland Athletics, who believed that underused statistics, such as a player's ability to get on base, better predict the ability to score runs than typical statistics like home runs, RBIs (runs batted in), and batting average. Obtaining players who excelled in these underused statistics turned out to be much more affordable for the team.\n",
