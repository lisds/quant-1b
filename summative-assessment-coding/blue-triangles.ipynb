    "In Figure 1(a) the circled item is the only triangle, but in the bottom image the circled item is one of two triangles. While in Figure 1(a) \"the triangle\" is a sufficient description for the circled item, many of us might choose to refer to it as the \"blue triangle\" anyway. In Figure 1(a) there are two triangles, so \"the triangle\" is no longer sufficient, and to describe the circled item we must qualify it with the color as well, as \"the blue triangle\".\n",

    "Your answers to the above questions might be different if you’re answering in a different language than English.

    "Researchers studying frequent use of redundant adjectives (e.g., referring to a single triangle as \"the blue triangle\") and incrementality of language processing designed an experiment where they showed the following two images to 22 native English speakers (undergraduates from University College London) and 22 native Spanish speakers (undergraduates from the Universidad de las Islas Baleares). They found that in both languages, the subjects used more redundant color adjectives in denser displays where it would be more efficient ([Rubio-Fernandez, Mollica, and Jara-Ettinger 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000963)). One of the displays from the study is shown in Figure 2.\n",
