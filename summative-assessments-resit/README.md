## Doing the assessment

NB OKpy/.ok might not work, so please ignore errors and output from running.

The exercise consists of four notebooks. Each notebook sits in its own
directory, with its own tests and data files.

Within each notebook, each question counts for the same number of
points, except where it says otherwise in the notebook.

The number of points for each notebook, from the total of 100, are:
- `lymphoma`: 20
- `pandering`: 20
- `religion`: 30
- `titanic`: 30

For example, the `lymphoma` notebook has 5 questions. Each counts for
20 / 5 = 4 marks out of the 100 marks available from this exercise.

## Submitting the assessment

First, once you've finished each notebook, be sure to:

- restart the kernel for this notebook, and run all the cells, to check that the notebook still works without errors. Use the "Kernel" menu, and choose "Restart and Run All". If you find any problems, go back and fix them, save the notebook, and restart / run all again, before submitting.

Submit the exercise by:

- Click on the "Download" button for each notebook file (NB they are `.Rmd` not `.ipynb`, but this doesn't change how you run them).

- Create a zip file; check it contains: lymphoma.Rmd; pandering.Rmd; religion.Rmd; titanic.Rmd;

- Submit this zip file, containing all four notebooks, to Cortex.

Please remember the rules for Working Together and use of AI, on Cortex.

Also, from that page, remember that do ask if you have tried a question but are stuck. The answer cannot be shared, but some pointers to help you become unstuck will be shared.

Any problems, please email.
